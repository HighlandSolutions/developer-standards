# Title
### Proposal to add a README

## Summary
We add a README file to our codebase when we start a project

## Reasoning
1. It helps people understand what the code does.
2. It helps new developers who join the project understand what is necessary to start using the code.

## Example/Instructions
1. A brief description of what the code does and what stack is used.
2. Instructions for installing your code.
   > This could be an init script `init.sh` or could outline the steps to install dependencies using a package manager like `npm`.
3. What other code needs to be installed for it to work.
   > If there is any other environment requirements for this to run. **Example**: if the code requires a certain version of php.
4. One or two examples of how to invoke your code.
   > **Example**: If it is vue based: `npm run watch`
5. Optionally: who wrote the code and who to contact for help.
