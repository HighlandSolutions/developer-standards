# Title
## Summary
We add a README file to our codebase when we start a project


## Reasoning
1. It helps people understand what the code does.
2. It helps new developers who join the project understand what is necessary to start using the code.

## Example/Instructions
1. A brief description of what the code does;
2. Instructions for installing your code;
3. What other code needs to be installed for it to work;
4. one or two examples of how to invoke your code;
5. optionally: who wrote the code, how to cite it, and who to contact for help.
<!--
1. Install a linter for each language used in your project.
    - PHP
      ```sh
      brew install php-code-sniffer
      ```
    - JavaScript
      ```sh
      yarn add -D eslint
      ```
2. Install editor extensions for the linters. Here are some popular options:
    - Atom
      - https://atom.io/packages/linter
      - https://atom.io/packages/linter-eslint
      - https://atom.io/packages/linter-phpcs
    - Sublime Text
      - https://packagecontrol.io/packages/SublimeLinter
      - https://packagecontrol.io/packages/SublimeLinter-eslint
      - https://packagecontrol.io/packages/SublimeLinter-phpcs
    - VS Code
      - https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint
      - https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ikappas.phpcs
3. Fix warnings/errors in your code before submitting for peer review.
