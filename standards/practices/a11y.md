# A11y: Accessibility
## Summary
We build applications that can be used by users with a variety of different abilities and follow public standards for accessibility.


## Reasoning
It is everyone's responsibility to keep in mind accessibility while developing web applications. We want our applications to be able to be used by as many people as possible. We can achieve this by following public accessibility guidlines and standards. 


## Example/Instructions
The list of development considerations that should be taken for accessibility is extensive and those included here are by no means exhaustive.

### Definitions
* a11y - Common shorthand for "accessibility" used in web design. (11 refers to the 11 letters between 'a' and 'y')
* WCAG - Web Content Accessibility Guidelines developed by W3C

### Accessibility we design/develop for
#### Visual Disabilities
Users who may be using a screen reader, or other tool to help comprehend the content of the page
##### Considerations
* Descriptive alt text is assigned to every meaningful image
* All hyperlinks and call actions have a descriptive title.
* Language for the webpage: `<html lang="en">` is set
* Semantic HTML structure is followed
* Text can be able to be resized up to 200% without negatively affecting the ability to read content or use functions
* Each page of the website has a unique and descriptive page meta title and meta description
* There are labels to all forms or input fields so that a user knows what input and what format is expected and read by screen readers
#### Auditory Disabilities

##### Considerations
* Closed captioning is provided for videos
* Text transcripts are provided for audios

#### Cognitive, learning, and neurological disabilities
