# Highland development standards
This is a living document of our [development standards](./standards). We encourage all Highland devs to contribute to it.

## We put people first
What we make and how we work should make it a little bit better to be alive: for us, our clients, and their customers.

We acknowledge that in defining and following standards, our behaviors and attitudes become more susceptible to rigidity, which is inconsistent with our value to put people first.

We commit to admitting to ourselves and our teammates when we allow adherence to standards to get in the way of our relationships and values.

We accept that our standards are imperfect and that sometimes it makes sense to override a standard.

We commit to setting aside our personal preferences and following the standards unless our team agrees overriding a standard at the project-level benefits the people affected.


## Purpose
Unifying behind standards makes our team dynamics and work more consistent, which in turn simplifies working with different teams on different projects and onboarding new team members.


## Applying standards
Our development standards apply to all projects involving development of any kind, but we recognize specific standards won't apply to every project (e.g. language-specific standards can't apply to a project not using that language).
